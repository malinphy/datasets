Methods of lowering the error rate of massively parallel DNA sequencing using duplex consensus sequencing,"Next Generation DNA sequencing promises to revolutionize clinical medicine and basic research.

Methods of lowering the error rate of massively parallel DNA sequencing using duplex consensus sequencing,"Next Generation DNA sequencing promises to revolutionize clinical medicine and basic research. However, while this technology has the capacity to generate hundreds of billions of nucleotides of DNA sequence in a single experiment, the error rate of approximately 1% results in hundreds of millions of sequencing mistakes. These scattered errors can be tolerated in some applications but become extremely problematic when “deep sequencing” genetically heterogeneous mixtures, such as tumors or mixed microbial populations. To overcome limitations in sequencing accuracy, a method Duplex Consensus Sequencing (DCS) is provided. This approach greatly reduces errors by independently tagging and sequencing each of the two strands of a DNA duplex. As the two strands are complementary, true mutations are found at the same position in both strands. In contrast, PCR or sequencing errors will result in errors in only one strand. This method uniquely capitalizes on the redundant information stored in double-stranded DNA, thus overcoming technical limitations of prior methods utilizing data from only one of the two strands."

Conversion of corn oil to upgraded biodiesel and poly(lactic acid),"Conversion of vegetable-derived triglycerides to fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) is a popular approach to the generation of biodiesel fuels and the basis of a growing industry. Drawbacks of the strategy are that (a) the glycerol backbone of the triglyceride is discarded as waste in this synthesis, and (2) many natural triglycerides are multiply-unsaturated or fully saturated, giving inferior performance and causing engine problems with long-term use. Here, we show that catalysis by iridium complex 1 can address both of these problems through selective reduction of triglycerides high in polyunsaturated fatty esters to FAMEs with high oleate concentration. This is realized using hydrogen imbedded in the triglyceride backbone, concurrently generating lactate as a value-added C3 product. Additional methanol or glycerol as a hydrogen source enables reduction of corn and soybean oils to >80% oleate."

γ-AA-peptide STAT3/DNA inhibitors and methods of use,"STAT3 hyperphosphorylation, dimerization and DNA binding are required for its ability to contribute to malignant transformation. As such, STAT3 has been recognized as a promising target for cancer therapy. Although a number of inhibitors of STAT3-STAT3 dimerization have been reported, molecular ligands that prevent interactions between STAT3 and DNA are very rare. The γ-AApeptide-based one-bead-one-compound (OBOC) combinatorial library was used, and identified γ-AApeptides that can selectively inhibit STAT3/DNA interaction and suppress the expression levels of STAT3 target genes in intact cells. The results not only validate γ-AApeptides as novel inhibitors of STAT3 signaling pathway, but also demonstrate that in addition to the SH2 domain, the DNA binding domain of STAT3 is targetable for the development of new generation of anti-cancer therapeutics. This also validates the approach of OBOC combinatorial library for the identification of ligands targeting traditionally recognized “undruggable targets”."

Compositions and methods for the modulation of the corticotropin releasing factor binding protein and the treatment of alcohol use disorder,"Stress responses involve corticotropin releasing factor (CRF), the two cognate receptors (CRF1 and CRF2) and the CRF-binding protein (CRFBP). Utilizing a novel cell-based assay, a C-terminal CRFBP fragment [CRFBP(10 kD)] was found to potentiates CRF-intracellular Ca2+ release, demonstrating that CRFBP possesses excitatory roles in addition to the inhibitory role established by the N-terminal fragment of CRFBP [CRFBP(27 kD)]. This interaction was CRF2-specific, as CRF1 responses were not potentiated by CRFBP(10 kD). As there were currently no small molecule ligands available that selectively interact with either CRFBP or CRF2, a cell-based assay was miniaturized, wherein CRFBP(10 kD) was fused as a chimera with CRF2α, that allowed us to a perform a high-throughput screen (HTS) of approximately 350,000 small molecules. This resulted in the identification of negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) of the CRFBP(10 kD)-CRF2 complex that blunt CRF-induced potentiation of N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR)-mediated synaptic transmission in dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA).

Simultaneous isolation and preconcentration of exosomes by ion concentration polarization method and apparatus,"Exosomes carry microRNA biomarkers, occur in higher abundance in cancerous patients than in healthy ones, and because they are present in most biofluids, including blood and urine, can be obtained non-invasively. Standard laboratory techniques to isolate exosomes are expensive, time-consuming, provide poor purity, and recover on the order of 25% of the available exosomes. We present a new microfluidic technique to simultaneously isolate exosomes and preconcentrate them by electrophoresis using a high transverse local electric field generated by ion-depleting ion-selective membrane. We use pressure-driven flow to deliver an exosome sample to a microfluidic chip such that the transverse electric field forces them out of the cross flow and into an agarose gel which filters out unwanted cellular debris while the ion-selective membrane concentrates the exosomes through an enrichment effect. We efficiently isolated exosomes from 1×PBS buffer, cell culture media and blood serum. Using flow rates from 150 μL/hr to 200 μL/hr and field strengths of 100 V/cm, we consistently captured between 60% to 80% of exosomes from buffer, cell culture media, and blood serum as confirmed by both fluorescence spectroscopy and nanoparticle tracking analysis.

Methods of lowering the error rate of massively parallel DNA sequencing using duplex consensus sequencing,"Next Generation DNA sequencing promises to revolutionize clinical medicine and basic research.

"Systems, methods, and apparatuses for implementing a self-supervised chest x-ray image analysis machine-learning model utilizing transferable visual words","Not only is annotating medical images tedious and time consuming, but it also demands costly, specialty-oriented expertise, which is not easily accessible. To address this challenge, a new self-supervised framework is introduced: TransVW (transferable visual words), exploiting the prowess of transfer learning with convolutional neural networks and the unsupervised nature of visual word extraction with bags of visual words, resulting in an annotation-efficient solution to medical image analysis. TransVW was evaluated using NIH ChestX-ray14 to demonstrate its annotation efficiency. When compared with training from scratch and ImageNet-based transfer learning, TransVW reduces the annotation efforts by 75% and 12%, respectively, in addition to significantly accelerating the convergence speed. More importantly, TransVW sets new records: achieving the best average AUC on all 14 diseases, the best individual AUC scores on 10 diseases, and the second best individual AUC scores on 3 diseases. This performance is unprecedented, because heretofore no self-supervised learning method has outperformed ImageNet-based transfer learning and no annotation reduction has been reported for self-supervised learning. These achievements are contributable to a simple yet powerful observation: The complex and recurring anatomical structures in medical images are natural visual words, which can be automatically extracted, serving as strong yet free supervision signals for CNNs to learn generalizable and transferable image representation via self-supervision."
